# OS_Algorithms

This project is about Operating Systems Scheduling Algorithms and analysing these algorithms with different inputs(csv).

####### timeCalc.py

This file contains functions to calculate ***turnaround_time*** , ***wating_time*** , ***response_time*** and a funtion to calculate average times

####### GetInput.py

This file contains a function  to get the input from csv file from given path and format the input in a python dictionary
